## A Next JS typescript-based Starter pack to start off your web3 project, clone this, and skip the initial repetitive steps.

### It includes : 

* Rainbow Kit, Wagmi & ethers: For connecting walling and playing with contracts
* Tailwindcss: CSS Framework

* Eslint & Prettier setup
* An IPFS file uploader functionality with 4everland
* NEXT PWA
* Zustand library for state management

### Configurations for PWA :

* If you don't want to use PWA at all then in next.config.js just export nextConfig without withPWA.
* If you only want to allow PWA to be shown on mobile and show a Page that asks to install PWA, then in config.js make useONlyPWAOnMobile true, and edit ADDPWAPage.tsx as you wish
* Configure public/manifest.json as per your app
